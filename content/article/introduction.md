# Introduction
BlogiNote is Nuxt Content Theme, it can generate static web pages by parsing `.md`, `.csv` and `.json` files.

You can use this theme to build your :scroll: long blog posts or show your :memo: snippet notes, because BlogiNote provide flexible layouts and multiple optimizations for different type of content.

If you want to have a look at the parsed web page, your can check out the [Example](./example/example-article-en) page first, and compare [the source `.md` file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Benbinbin/BlogiNote/main/content/article/example/1.example-article-en.md) side by side.

It looks pretty good :wink: right?
