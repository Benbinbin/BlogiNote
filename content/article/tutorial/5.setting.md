# Setting

BlogiNote is flexible enough to meet your needs, it provides different ways to set the project.

## App Config
You can set some properties for the whole website at the `app.config.ts` file

the default values of these properties are shown below, you can rewrite some of them at the `app.config.ts` of your project.

```ts [app.config.ts]
export default defineAppConfig({
  theme: {
    meta: {
      name: 'BlogiNote',
      description: 'A Nuxt theme for showing blog posts and snippet notes with flexible layouts and multiple optimizations.',
      author: 'Benbinbin',
      url: 'https://bloginote.benbinbin.com/'
    },
    author: 'Benbinbin',
    email: 'benthomsonbin@gmail.com',
    avatar: '/default-avatar.png',
    favicon: '/default-favicon.ico',
    homePage: {
      showBlogPosts: true,
      postItemLimit: 5
    },
    subscribePage: true,
    articlePage: {
      showTime: true,
      outdated: {
        show: true,
        threshold: 30
      },
      showBlogCatalog: false,

* **[`showNoteCatalog`]{.text-purple-500} property** is used to set whether to display the catalog of the article at initial state (when the page open first) at "note" mode

## Front Matter
You can add some metadata for the special article by add some YAML within `---` three dashes at the top of the markdown file, these contents call Front Matter.

::TipBox{type="announce"}
We won't see this metadata after the markdown file convert to the website page. So you shouldn't worry about the "dirty" header will make the article in a mess.

It is written in a special format called [YAML or YML](https://yaml.org/), this format is make up of a list of `key: value` pairs.
