# Write an article

This tutorial will show you how to write an article.

## Editor for Writing

You can choose any [Markdown Editor](https://github.com/mundimark/awesome-markdown-editors) as you like to write the article

::TipBox{type="tip"}
If you already [setup the development environment](./get-start#setup-environment-optional) on your local PC, you can also write article at VS Code.

There are some useful VS Code extensions you can install to help you optimize the user experience when writing markdown files:

* [Markdown Preview Enhanced](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=shd101wyy.markdown-preview-enhanced)
* [MDC](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Nuxt.mdc)
::

## Where to write

::TipBox{type="tldr"}
* Writing articles inside the :file_folder: `/content/article` folder
* Each markdown file is an article, they will auto generate to website pages.
* The :page_facing_up: `/content/index.md` file set the introduction content for Home Page
* The :page_facing_up: `/content/about.md` file set the content for About Page
* Please follow the rules about the name of file and folder name
::

You may get confused because the project contains :dizzy_face: a mess of sub-folders or files. But don't be panic, **most of the time you can just focus the :file_folder: `/content` folder**, which is the container for all article files.

Have a look at the :file_folder: `/content` folder, you can the `*.md` file. Yep, this's article, which written in a special syntax call Markdown.

::TipBox{type="tip"}
You can read the next chapter of this article *[How to write](#how-to-write)* to learn more about it.
::

Firstly you can create two special files inside :file_folder: `/content` folder:

* :page_facing_up: `/content/index.md` this file setting the introduction content of the [Home Page](/)

* :page_facing_up: `/content/about.md` this file setting the content of [About Page](/about)

<!-- You can rewrite the content of these two files :page_facing_up: `/content/index.md` and :page_facing_up: `/content/about.md` to change the relative part of Home Page or About Page. -->

Then you may notice the :file_folder: `/content/article` folder, which contains all articles.

For example this website is also built by BlogiNote, you can check out the project structure in [Github](https://github.com/Benbinbin/BlogiNote), and find out this article inside the [sub-folder](https://github.com/Benbinbin/BlogiNote/tree/main/content/article/tutorial) :file_folder: `/content/article/tutorial`.

<!-- You can delete all the existed articles inside the :file_folder: `/content/article` folder (but please keep the `/content/article` folder), then create a new markdown file inside the :file_folder: `/content/article` folder and start to :pencil: write you own article. -->

::TipBox{type="warning"}
The engine will auto generate websites (and relative URLs) based on the folders structure and the markdown files content.

You must follow some rules about folder and file name to avoid weird situation:

* it's a good idea that the name of folder or file just consists of number and alphabet
* folder or file name should be the lower-case, because the URL is not case-sensitive
* use hyphen `-` to separate word but **not** the space bar, because the URL will convert the space bar to `%20`
::

## How to write
BlogiNote can consume three types of file to generate web page, they are **Markdown** file, **JSON** file and **CSV** file:

* [:IconCustom{name='bi:markdown'} **Markdown file**]{.text-purple-500}

    The file extension name is `.md`. Open a file in this type, you can see plain text with some strange marks, like `###`, which means the level 3 heading. With some simple syntax rules, it can convert the plain text content to rich text content.

    ::TipBox{type="tip"}
    You can also learning Markdown basic syntax from the following two websites:

    * [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/): this website shows the most basic syntax, like how to mark a header, a link, an image and so on

    * [GitHub Flavored Markdown Spec (GFM)](https://github.github.com/gfm/): this website shows the GFM syntax, which is another Markdown extended syntax created by Github, like supporting the footnote
    ::

* [:IconCustom{name='bi:filetype-json'} **JSON file**]{.text-orange-500}

    The file extension name is `.json`. Open a file in this type, you can see the content like a tree. The data of this file is in a nested hierarchical structure, layer by layer.

* [:IconCustom{name='bi:filetype-csv'} **CSV file**]{.text-green-500}

  The file extension name is `.csv`. Open a file in this type, you can see a lot of Comma, because `CSV` is the abbreviation of Comma-Separated Values. It's one of the most common file type for spreadsheet, you maybe edit many time of these files in Microsoft Excel

### Markdown
Because Markdown provides some useful syntax rules to mark the plain text content, you can easily write a blog post in rich text format, with heading, list, quote and so on.

Most of the time, you will write a blog post in markdown file, BlogiNote support basic Markdown syntax and MarkDown Components extended syntax (also called [MDC](https://content.nuxtjs.org/guide/writing/mdc/) for short).

The following parts will show some details you should pay attention to when writing markdown file:

#### link

The syntax of url link in markdown is `[Google](www.google.com)`, the content inside the square brackets `[]` will show in the page, and the content inside the parentheses `()` is the url.

If you want to link to the page inside your project, you should use the **Relative Link**, which start with `.` and `..`

* the `.` dot at the start of the url path means the **folder** where the current file is located
* the `..` two dots at the start of the url path means the **parent folder** where the current file is located

For example the markdown file `content/article/tutorial/example.md` is inside the :file_folder: `tutorial` folder, if you want to write a link in the `example.md` to the page generated by the markdown file `content/article/tutorial/setting.md`, it should be like `[setting page](./setting)`

::TipBox{type="tip"}
Please notice that the file extension `.md` **don't** need to add to the url path.
::

Another example is adding a link in the `example.md` to the page generated by the markdown file `content/article/setting.md`, it should be like `[setting page](../setting)`


If you want to link to the heading inside the page, you should use the **Anchor Link**, which start with `#`.

For example the markdown file has a heading named `How to Write` and the anchor link should be `[link](#how-to-write)`

::TipBox{type="tip"}
Please notice that all the words are lowercase, and use the hyphen `-` to link them together.
::

You can also combine these two special types of link together to write a link which point to particular heading of another page, like `[link](./setting#front-matter)`


#### Code
::TipBox{type="announce"}
Firstly, you should know the concept of **highlight theme** and the **preload program languages**.

**Highlight theme** is a color rules to decorate the code text based on the program language.

**Preload program languages** is a list of program languages, which are selected for the highlight engine, and the server will do some work under the hook, to make sure the block code content highlighted correctly.

These two concept should be set inside the :page_facing_up: `nuxt.config.ts` file.

You can read the *[Choose your code highlight Theme](./faq#choose-your-code-highlight-Theme)* and *[Add some preload program languages](./faq#add-some-preload-program-languages)* these two part of the [FAQ](./faq) article.
::

Markdown support two types of code:

* inline code: the code inside the paragraph, writing inline code between the **backquote**

    ::TabGroup
        ::TabItem{name="Markdown"}
        ![inline code](./images/inline-code.png)
        ::

        ::TabItem{name="Result"}
        Markdown file extension name is `.md`
        ::
    ::

    ::TipBox{type="tip"}
    Usually the backquote key is under `Esc` key in your keyboard
    ::

* block code: the code show as a block, writing block code between **three backquote**

    ::TabGroup
        ::TabItem{name="Markdown"}
        ![block code](./images/block-code.png)
        ::

        ::TabItem{name="Result"}
        ```javascript
        console.log('hello world!')
        ```
        ::
    ::

    ::TipBox{type="warning"}
    In order to highlight the code correctly, you **must** specify which program language the block code belongs to right after the three backquote

    The block code highlight engine is Shiki, which supports a hundreds of program languages.

    But to be more accurate, you should check out [this page](https://github.com/shikijs/shiki/blob/main/docs/languages.md) first, and make sure that Shiki support the program language your block code belongs to.

    If the program language isn't supported, or you don't know which program language the block code belong to, **you can assign to the `md` or `markdown`** as a fallback solution.
    ::

    you can also provide more information about your code block:

    * **add the file name** inside the square brackets, like `[filename]`, to specify where the code come from

        ::TipBox{type="tip"}
        you can also add a link to specify the source of the code block, the link should start with `https`, `http` or `www`
        ::

    * **highlight some lines** of your code block by adding some number inside the curly brackets, like `{2-4, 6}` to highlight the lines from second to fourth, and the sixth line

    ::TabGroup
        ::TabItem{name="Markdown"}
        ![block code with more info](./images/block-code-with-more-info.png)
        ::

        ::TabItem{name="Result"}
        ```javascript [/components/content/ProseCode.vue] {2-4, 6}
        const languageColorMap = {
        theme: '#a855f7',
        bash: '#89e051',
        shell: '#89e051',
        html: '#e34c26',
        javascript: '#f1e05a',
        }
        ```
        ::
    ::

#### MDC
MDC stand for MarkDown Components extended syntax, it expand the edge of the ability of Markdown by embedding the Vue components.

You can check out another tutorial ***[MDC](./mdc)*** to learn more about the build-in MDC provided by BlogiNote.

## Set title
There are many ways to set the article title:

* the markdown file name

* the level 1 heading (which is only with one `#` hashtag) in the article (and it should be the first element in the article)

* setting the `title` property at Front Matter

the priority level is `title` property > the level 1 heading > file name

Most of the time you only need to write a level 1 heading at the begin of the article (if your article has some Front Matter content, the level 1 heading should be follow the Front Matter).

If you don't want to write the level 1 heading at the top of the article, and you don't like the file name as the article title, you can provide the `title` property at Front Matter to rewrite the title of the article.

::TipBox{type="warning"}
Please don't provide the `title` property and the level 1 heading at the same time, because the level 1 heading will always be hidden, and only show the `title` property as the article title in web page.
::

::TipBox{type="announce"}
the url of the article is always based on the file system path and the file name.
::

## Add a cover

::TipBox{type="tldr"}
Add the `cover: image_file_path` property in Front Matter at the top of your markdown file
::

<!-- Open the :page_facing_up: `/content/article/tutorial/write-article.md` file in this project, you maybe notice at the top of this article there're `---` three dashes -->

::TipBox{type="announce"}
We add some metadata for page by add some YAML within `---` three dashes at the top of the article, this's also called Front Matter.

We won't see this metadata after the markdown file convert to the website page. So you shouldn't worry about the "dirty" header will make the article in a mess.

It is written in a special format called [YAML or YML](https://yaml.org/), this format is make up of a list of `key: value` pairs, for example in this project, you can add `cover: ./images/write.jpg` to set a cover for this article.
::

::TipBox{type="tip"}
The image will be shown at the top of the article and the right corner of home page article list item.
::

You can use the local image or remote image as the cover:

* If you want to link the local image file as the cover, you should use the **relative path** which starts with a dot `.`

    1. Download the image first

        For example I download an [image](https://unsplash.com/photos/xG8IQMqMITM) (Photo by [Aaron Burden](https://unsplash.com/@aaronburden) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/)), and rename the file name as `write.jpg`

    2. Then put it into the project.

        For example I put the image into the folder :file_folder: `/content/article/tutorial/images` which is close to the markdown article file `/content/article/tutorial/write-article.md`

    3. now the image **relative path** for markdown article is `./images/write.jpg` so add `cover: ./images/write.jpg` at the top of this article within `---` three dashes

        ::TipBox{type="tip"}
        starts dot `.` of the **relative path** means the folder current file belong to.

        In this example, the current file is the :page_facing_up: `write-article.md` file, so the `.` is the the alias of :file_folder: `tutorial` folder
        ::

* If you want to link the remote image file as the cover, just need to use the url as the the image path

    For example I want to use this [image](https://i.picsum.photos/id/0/5616/3744.jpg?hmac=3GAAioiQziMGEtLbfrdbcoenXoWAW-zlyEAMkfEdBzQ) as the cover, which url is `https://i.picsum.photos/id/0/5616/3744.jpg?hmac=3GAAioiQziMGEtLbfrdbcoenXoWAW-zlyEAMkfEdBzQ`

    So I just need to add `cover: https://i.picsum.photos/id/0/5616/3744.jpg?hmac=3GAAioiQziMGEtLbfrdbcoenXoWAW-zlyEAMkfEdBzQ` at the top of this article within `---` three dashes
